# QA-Chatbot-over-Documents-with-Sources
building a Question Answering (QA) Chatbot that works over documents and provides sources of information for its answers. Our QA Chatbot uses a chain (specifically, the RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain), and leverages it to sift through a collection of documents, extracting relevant information to answer queries.
